# CSE_CLUB_Fall_2019_beginner_Python_Project
Repo for CSE Club Python beginner fall 2019 project

This was a database created and modified to introduce dynamic interfaces and databases to the 
Computer Software and Engineering club students.

Three students were involved and their roles and responsibilities are as follows:

Christian Mesina is one of two Back End developers for the project. Christian was resposnsible
for implementing the functionality of the database along side with Steven Ortega.

The Start definition to establish the connection between the SQLit3 Library and the 
program's definitions were created by Christian.
Through the implementation of the Insert Functionality, Christian engineered a 
function that establishes the connection to the database and adds to the existing binary
file.
The Print function was alos implemented by Christian, allowing the back end to print 
entries onto the console independently from the GUI to help troubleshoot and verify
entries.

Steven Ortega is the second Backend developer for the project. 
Steven's role are the search and delete functionality of the project.
The Remove function had to be able to read in input from the GUI and allocate the entry in order to delete it.
This process was accomplished by using SQL queries for the desired entry.
The second function was the Search definition, which like the Remove, was also dependent upon both SQL language
and Python code.

Madelyn Pulido is the Frontend developer for the project. Madelyn created a GUI that utilized function calls to correlate 
front end widget behavior to backend code functionality. All of the user interface was design and implemented by Madelyn.

The GUI has text fields that take in tuples for SQLIT3 to write into a binary text file for storage on a local host.

After the GUI is initialated, a main loop runs until the user manually terminates the process. This way, as many or little entries 
can be made, modified, or deleted within each iteration of the project execution.
